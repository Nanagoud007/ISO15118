## üöÄ **Top 5 Advantages of ISO 15118**

### 1. **Plug-and-Charge (PnC)**
- No manual authentication required: The vehicle automatically identifies itself to the charging station, eliminating the need for RFID cards, apps, or manual input.
- Automatic identification and billing: Secure digital certificates enable seamless user authentication and direct billing without user intervention.
- Seamless user experience: Drivers simply plug in and charging starts, making the process as easy as possible.

### 2. **Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)**
- Bidirectional power flow: EVs can both draw power from and supply power back to the grid, enabling new energy services.
- Grid stabilization capabilities: V2G allows EVs to help balance supply and demand, supporting grid reliability and renewable integration.
- Revenue opportunities for users: EV owners can earn money by providing energy or grid services during peak demand or emergencies.

### 3. **Enhanced Security**
- PKI-based digital certificates: Uses advanced cryptography for secure authentication and communication between EV, charger, and backend.
- Advanced privacy protection: Ensures user and vehicle data is protected from unauthorized access or misuse.
- Fraud prevention: Strong security mechanisms reduce the risk of unauthorized charging or billing fraud.

### 4. **Smart Grid Integration**
- Demand response capabilities: Charging can be scheduled or modulated based on grid needs, reducing stress during peak times.
- Load balancing: Helps distribute energy demand more evenly, improving grid efficiency and reducing costs.
- Renewable energy optimization: Supports charging when renewable energy is abundant, lowering carbon footprint and costs.

### 5. **Rich Data Exchange**
- Comprehensive vehicle information: Enables the exchange of detailed battery status, charging preferences, and diagnostics.
- Battery state and preferences: The system can optimize charging based on real-time battery health and user preferences.
- Advanced analytics opportunities: Rich data enables better energy management, predictive maintenance, and user insights.
